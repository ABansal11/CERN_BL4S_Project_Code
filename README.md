# CERN_BL4S_Project_Code
The following repository contains the code for the simulations for CERN BL4S Project of "Team AstroCAS". The proposal was selected as one of the top 27 internationally out of almost 400 proposals, and also received the Outreach Special Award. In this project, I have attempted to predict the effect of space-like radiation on the performance of batteries commonly used in the space industry. The purpose of the proposal is to find which batteries are most suitable for future space travel and best at maintaining structural and electronic integrity.
